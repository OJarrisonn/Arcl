# Arcl - Adaptive Runtime Creative Language

Arcl is yet another programming language. But our aim is to be as much adaptable as possible to the developer needs.

## Features

Some features that Arcl will include are:
- **Run C/C++/Python functions**: you can write functions in another and then call it from a Arcl program
- **Point to everything**: everything in your program can be stored as a pointer
- **Boxes**: our "variables" are called "boxes", and they can do way more things than just storing values

### Box concept

A box is basically the thing that stores information in your program. The information is stored in memory and your box has a pointer to it. And what are informations? Everything! Literals (numbers, booleans, strings, chars and custom literals), objects, arrays, functions, types, structures, no, etc.

This concept permits the developer to have way more options, because everything can be stored into a box and you can use your box in everything (just like, function parameters)

### Custom literals

Every type can have it's own literals (even custom types)
